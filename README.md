# Jak II - Refreshed HUD
A handmade recreation of Jak II's HUD in HD for the OpenGOAL PC port. Most of the textures are remade in 4x scale because it felt like the sweet spot.

HUD icons of ingame objects such as Krew's money bags are cutouts of screenshots I took, or renders borrowed from the Jak and Daxter Wiki page. The rest are pretty much made from scratch.

AI upscaling was only used in the Japanese and Korean font textures. However, the main font texture was vectorized and exported in a higher resolution.

Unfortunately due to how the maps and map icons work in the game, currently they can't be edited. If that is to change in the future, I'll make sure to include them here.

Something else worth noting is that Jak's health points are slightly misalinged due to how they are positioned in the code. It will look worse in wider aspect ratios. Just ignore that for now :)

## Setup
1. Download latest release
2. Open the OpenGOAL Launcher
3. Go to Jak II -> Features -> Texture Packs
4. Click 'Add New Pack'
5. Within the downloaded ZIP, select the folder **WHICH CONTAINS THE custom_assets FOLDER**
6. Click 'Apply Texture Changes'
7. Wait for it to finish decompiling
8. Enjoy!
